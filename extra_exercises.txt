Multiple For loops

1. Write a Python program that prints the multiplication table of a given integer n up to a certain limit k. 
2. Countdown timer
3. Create a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100, and then asks the user to guess the number. If the user's guess is too high or too low, give them a hint and ask them to guess again. Keep repeating this until the user guesses the correct number.
4. Create a program that prompts the user to enter a list of names, separated by commas. Convert the input string into a list of strings, and then print the names in alphabetical order.
5. Remove duplicates from list

6. Create an empty dict 
7. add the key 'book' with value 'read'
8. create a variable `temp` with value `car`
9. add the temp as key to above dict with value `drive`
10. create a new dict with keys and value `google=search,youtube=watch,blogs=read`
11. update the dict created before with the new dict
12. Remove the key `book` while removing get it's value
13. With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i*i) such that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included). and then the program should print the dictionary.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
Then, the output should be:
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}

13. Create a program that prompts the user to enter a list of numbers, separated by commas. Convert the input string into a list of integers, and then print only the numbers that are greater than 10.
