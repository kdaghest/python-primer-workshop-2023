"""
1. Write a function that takes a string as input and converts it to an integer. If the input cannot be converted to an integer, raise a custom exception called InvalidInputError. Write a test case that calls this function with a non-integer input and asserts that the InvalidInputError exception is raised.

2. Write a function that takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of the first 5 numbers in the list. If the list contains less than 5 numbers, raise a ValueError exception. Write a test case that calls this function with a list containing only 3 numbers and asserts that the ValueError exception is raised.

3. Write a function that takes a dictionary as input and returns the value associated with a given key. If the key is not in the dictionary, raise a KeyError exception. Write a test case that calls this function with a dictionary that does not contain the requested key and asserts that the KeyError exception is raised.

4. Write a function that takes two integers as input and returns the quotient of their division. If the second integer is 0, raise a ZeroDivisionError exception. Write a test case that calls this function with a second integer of 0 and asserts that the ZeroDivisionError exception is raised.

5. Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the length of the string. If the input is not a string, raise a TypeError exception. Write a test case that calls this function with an integer as input and asserts that the TypeError exception is raised.
