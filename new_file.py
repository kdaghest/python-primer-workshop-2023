With a given integral number n,  # input()-  number n
write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i*i)  1 and n (both included). and 
then the program should print the dictionary.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
Then, the output should be:
5 
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4:16, 5:25}

8
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}

Updated version
If you did normal for loops 
check dictionary comprehension
