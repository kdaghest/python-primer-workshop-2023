# Try the following in Python shell

# Ex :: 1

a = input()
# Enter 100

b = input()
# Enter 200

# add a and b

z = a + b

# print the output

print (z)

# What are you getting? Why?




# How can we fix this?
# Hint :: Types

z = int(a) + int(b)
print (z)


# Ex:: 2


# Can we do the same for lists?
z = input()


# What happens if we do list(z) 
# store list(z) in b

b = list(z)

# Convert z to `int`

b = int(z)













# Solve problems in exercises.md,
