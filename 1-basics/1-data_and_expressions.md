## Data Types

> Try the following in Python shell

Integer: An integer is a whole number without a fractional component. For example:

```
x = 5
y = -10
z = 0
```

Float: A float is a number with a decimal point. For example:

```
x = 3.14
y = -2.5
z = 0.0
```

String: A string is a sequence of characters, enclosed in either single or double quotes. For example:

```
x = "Hello, world!"
y = 'Python is awesome'
z = "12345"
```

Boolean: A boolean is a data type that can have one of two possible values: True or False. For example:

```
x = True
y = False
```

List: A list is a collection of values, separated by commas and enclosed in square brackets. For example:

```
a = []
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
z = [True, 2, 'three']
```

Tuple: A tuple is similar to a list, but its values cannot be modified once it has been created. Tuples are enclosed in parentheses. For example:

```
x = (1, 2, 3)
y = ('red', 'green', 'blue')
```

Set: A set is an unordered collection of unique values, enclosed in curly braces. For example:

```
x = {1, 2, 3}
y = {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}
```

Dictionary: A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs, enclosed in curly braces and separated by colons. For example:

```
x = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}
y = {'apple': 1, 'banana': 2, 'cherry': 3}
```

## Operators & Expressions

### Arithmetic

```
+ (addition)
- (subtraction)
* (multiplication)
/ (division)
% (modulo)
```

### Assignment

```
= (assignment)
+= (addition and assignment)
-= (subtraction and assignment)
*= (multiplication and assignment)
/= (division and assignment)
```

### Comparison

```
== (equal to)
!= (not equal to)
< (less than)
> (greater than)
<= (less than or equal to)
>= (greater than or equal to)
```

### Logical

```
and (returns True if both conditions are True)
or (returns True if at least one condition is True)
not (reverses the Boolean value of a condition)
```

### Identity

```
is (returns True if both objects have the same identity)
is not (returns True if both objects have different identities)
```

### Membership

```
in (returns True if the value is present in the sequence)
not in (returns True if the value is not present in the sequence)
```

## Input/Output

```
x = input()
print (x)
```
